# Secure Coding Practices

## Project Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate the practical differences between secure and non-secure coding practices within a Django web application. The focus is on authentication systems, showcasing common vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them through improved coding practices.

## Objectives
- To highlight common security flaws in web applications.
- To demonstrate secure coding practices that mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- To compare the behavior of the application with and without security enhancements.

## Features
- **Non-Secure Authentication Module**: Implements basic authentication without security considerations.
- **Secure Authentication Module**: Enhances the basic module by integrating best practices such as password hashing, HTTPS, input validation (Following OWASP Secure Coding Practices)

## Technology Stack
- **Back-End**: Django (version 3.2)
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (default for Django)
- **Security Testing Tools**: SonarQube, ZAP, BurpSuite.
